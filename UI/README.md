## AutoMart UI, An Andela Cycle 7 Bootcamp Challenge

This section of our project AutoMart is about building user interfaces elements that will be later on consuming our api endpoints.
It is entirely written in HTML,CSS,Javascript as required by the project requirements reason why some links and some parts of this application will not work properly untill the server side and api endpoints are implemented.
